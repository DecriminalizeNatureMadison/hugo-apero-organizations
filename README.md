# hugo-apero-organizations

This is a fork of [Hugo Apéro](https://github.com/hugo-apero/hugo-apero) with some changes added to accommodate Decriminalize Nature Madison. Hugo Apéro is a Hugo theme for personal websites.

See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) for a list of changes. Changes that make sense for general use are contributed back upstream :)
